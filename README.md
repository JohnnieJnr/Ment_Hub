## Project

This contains the files used to make our webpage, our Global Code group project - The Mentorship Hub.
The project is targeted at connecting youth and infants in the working world with professionals who would give the former mentoring that will help in their fields of endeavour. The project is also targeted at helping to achieve two of the Sustainable Development Goals: Quality Education and Partnerships to achieve goals.
Our group likes the idea of expanding this project even after the Global Code Summer Camp.
Our group is called Mentors; we're a team of four, and we're Global Coders:

    Selma Nunana Agbevanu - the leader
    
    Johnnie Oduro Jnr - the integration lead
    
    Mathew Yao E. Tenu
    
    Mark Ahiabor
